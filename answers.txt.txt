Theory
Git is a version control system that helps keep track of changes to a file. It is useful when collaborating on a project with multiple team members. At any point git can help them track chaages, see the authors of those changes and add their code inputs. 

There are several basic Git commands in creating and pushing project changes to GitHub.

Setting up your git hub
Head to github.com and Create an account

Set up your username and email in your text editor
git config --global user.name "Your Name"

git config --global user.email "you@example.com"

Creating your first repository 
1. Identify the name of the directory in your local repository (i.e) your personal computer or mac. 
2. Create a folder in Git Hub with the same name as the created directory in your local repository.
3. Launch your text editor and ensure you cd to your working directory
4. Initialise git in your directory using the git init command
5. Check to see if git has been initialised. If it has you'll see a .git icon in your directory. You can see this by ls the items in your directory or checking via the GUI
5. Use the Git add 'filename' command to stage the file you want to track in your working directory.  
6. After makiing xhanges to your staged file. you can commit those changes with the command git commit -m 'commit message' the commit message means a tag with which you label the changes made 
7. Create a new brach using the Git branch -main
8. Link your virtual repository git remote add origin "insert a copied link of the repository created in Git Hub"
9. Git push -u origin main to push changes to Git Hub
